       <h3>What is Shopper on the Go?</h3>
       <p>Shopper on the Go is an application designed to enhance your shopping experience by offering MobiPromos on mobile devices that can be redeemed right at the participating restaurants, retail stores and shops.</p>
       <br/>
       <h3>How can I sign up as a shopper?</h3>
       <p>If you don&#39;t have an account already, click &ldquo;Login&rdquo; at the top righthand corner. It will take you to the registration page. Complete the form as requested and you will be on your way to saving money!</p>
       <br/>
       <h3>What&#39;s the difference between &ldquo;MobiPromos&rdquo; and &ldquo;My MobiPromos?&rdquo;</h3>
       <p>&ldquo;MobiPromos&rdquo; are all the available&nbsp;promotions out there. &ldquo;My MobiPromos&rdquo; are the&nbsp;promotions from your subscribed categories and special&nbsp;promotions you saved by clicking &ldquo;save&rdquo; on any&nbsp;MobiPromo from the &ldquo;MobiPromos&rdquo; page.</p>
    
        <br/>
       <h3>How can I subscribe to the MobiPromos that I am interested in?</h3>
       <p>Login to your account and click &ldquo;Preference&rdquo; then select &ldquo;Profile&rdquo;  then select &ldquo;Categories&rdquo; - this will bring up a list of categories. Check off the categories whose MobiPromos you are interested in receiving. You should see a list of the MobiPromos showing up in &ldquo;My MobiPromos&rdquo; once you refresh the page.</p>
         <br/>
        <h3>How can I find the MobiPromos near me?</h3>
       <p>If you are near a shopping center, &quot;Around me&quot; will list all the available&nbsp;MobiPromos within a specified mile radius. &quot;Map it&quot; will show you the pin drops of the stores. Click on one of the pins to see the location of the store and it will map out the path for you should you choose to go there.</p>
       <br/>
       <h3>How can I redeem a MobiPromo?</h3>
       <p>Redeeming a MobiPromo is very easy. Find the store and the MobiPromo you like, show the cashier the MobiPromo image on your mobile device, and then press the button on the MobiPromo with &ldquo;<strong>Redeem it</strong>&rdquo;. Voila! You&rsquo;ve saved money!</p>
       <br/>
       <h3>What if store cashier does not accept the MobiPromo?</h3>
       <p>All MobiPromos listed on Shopper on the Go are redeemable. We work with shops/stores to ensure that all MobiPromos from Shopper on the Go are honored and accepted at the store. You should ask for the store manager if you run into problems with the cashier, but if you still have problems, please contact us so we may resolve the issue for you quickly.</p>
       <br/>
       <h3>What is &ldquo;Save MobiPromo&rdquo;?</h3>
       <p>&ldquo;Save MobiPromo&rdquo; allows you to save paper&nbsp;promotions sent via snail mail by taking a picture of the&nbsp;promotion with your iPhone and thus converting it into a MobiPromo.&nbsp; This MobiPromo will be placed in &ldquo;My MobiPromos&rdquo; and roam with you automatically.</p>
